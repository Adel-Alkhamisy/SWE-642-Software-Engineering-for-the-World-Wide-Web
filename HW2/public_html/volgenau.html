    Listed below is information about the online directory, how email addresses are displayed, how to update your directory information, 
    and search examples.

    A. About People Finder
    This online university directory contains student, faculty, and staff information. You can search for a name, NetID (Mason username), 
    phone number, fax number, building, mail stop, job title, or department. Titles such as Mr., Ms., Dr., etc. are not recognized.

    B. How Email Addresses are Displayed
    To reduce spam, email addresses in People Finder are only shown when accessed through the on-campus network of George Mason University. 
    Off-campus users must log in with their Mason NetID and password to access the full directory. Non-affiliated off-campus users do not have access to email addresses for privacy reasons.

    Student email addresses: Virginia House Bill 1 (HB1), which took effect on July 1, 2018 as Code of Virginia section 23.1-405(C), 
    prohibits a university from disclosing a student’s email address, physical address or telephone number under the directory information 
    exception of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) or the Virginia Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), unless the student
    has affirmatively consented in writing to the disclosure.

    Students who would like Mason to share their contact information for legitimate educational purposes can provide their consent by completing 
    the HB1 Opt-In.

    Additional information regarding HB1 and the HB1 Opt-In form can be found on Mason’s FERPA HB1 Guidance website.

    C. How to Update Directory Information
    Faculty, Staff and Affiliates: Fill out the online form with corrections or updates. Questions about updating faculty/staff directory 
    information can be directed to University Information at masondir@gmu.edu. Requests to update directory information will be processed 
    within 3-5 business days. Uploads usually occur weekly on Friday.

    Students: Student names are updated in the directory at the beginning of the fall and spring semesters, 
    after the add/drop period. To NOT be listed, visit the Office of the University Registrar and complete a Directory Hold Form. Updates 
    to student email listings through the HB1 Opt-In usually occur weekly on Friday.

    D. Some Search Examples
    johns finds Johns, Johnson, etc.
    jo finds all combinations containing any of the letters in the name or location
    m johns finds all combinations containing any of the letters in the name or location Mary Johns, Maurice Johnson, 
    Admissions in the Johnson Center, etc.
    6789 finds people with phone numbers containing 6789
    The record has to match all of the words and numbers in a query.
    Web Access to the University Directory server is maintained by Information Technology Services. The University Directory is for 
    the exclusive use of the George Mason University community or anyone having a specific interest in reaching individual students, 
    faculty, staff and affiliates for educational purposes. Use of this directory as a mailing listing or telephone listing for other 
    solicitations is strictly prohibited.</p>
